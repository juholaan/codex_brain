"""Behavior controls for the unpushed / no-remote drift surface (MYC-2070).

The capability this covers shipped to a PRIVATE personal repo while its four
lighter dev-hygiene siblings were already public, so a client install got the
cheap hooks and not the one that says "you have committed work backed up
nowhere" (Substrate Is Product; ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-ACTIVATION). File presence is
not the assertion — BEHAVIOR on a clean install is:

  * a repo with NO remote and a >24h commit                 -> fires NO_REMOTE
  * a fully-pushed repo                                     -> silent
  * a `.no-remote-ok`-marked repo                           -> silent
  * a repo listed in the config's `no_remote_ok`            -> silent
  * many topic branches with local-only commits             -> DEMOTED to a
    count, never headlined (cry-wolf is the failure MYC-683 exists to prevent)
  * $ABS_DEV_ROOT / config `dev_root`                       -> honored, so the
    surface is not hardcoded to one operator's ~/dev
