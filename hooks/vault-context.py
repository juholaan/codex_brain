"""
UserPromptSubmit hook: detect strategic topics, read key vault files, inject as additionalContext.
Fires before Codex responds — no instructions needed, context is just there.

Vault resolution (MYC-3529, same defect as #375/#404): this hook used to bind
`VAULT = os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT", str(Path.home() / "vault"))` at import.
Both branches were wrong. UNSET, it read `~/vault/⚙️ Meta/Current Priorities.md`,
which does not exist on any vault not literally named "vault" — every read
returned None, `parts` stayed length 1, and the hook exited 0 injecting nothing,
silently, forever. SET, it named ONE vault, so a session working in a SECOND
vault got the FIRST vault's priorities injected as if they were its own — worse
than nothing, because the model cannot tell injected context is from the wrong
place.

Now: resolve per invocation from the session's cwd (vault_root_for — detection
from the target first, $VAULT_ROOT as fallback). No vault identified → inject
nothing, which is the honest answer.

# MYC-3529: REQUIRED, not cosmetic. This module annotates with PEP-604
# `X | None`, which is evaluated at def-time and is a TypeError on Python
# 3.9 -- the floor version scripts/ci.sh's gate actually runs. py_compile
# does NOT catch it (the annotation compiles fine and only blows up when
# the def executes), so the import crash is invisible to the lint gates and
# shows up only as a hook that silently does nothing.
