PreToolUse Bash hook: vault-wide command nudges + blocks.

Adapted from anthropics/claude-code examples/hooks/bash_command_validator_example.py.

Enforces AGENTS.md rules that were codified but not hook-blocked:
- Blocks `git push` against the personal vault repo (no remote configured)
- Blocks unscoped `git status` against the vault repo (60K-file walk)
- Blocks `rm -rf` against a vault root or any of its top-level folders
- Nudges `grep` -> Grep tool / rg, `find -name` -> Glob tool

Three scoping models, tagged per rule:

- repo-scoped (git push / git status): fire ONLY when the git op targets
  the personal vault repo itself, or a worktree of it. Repo identity is
  resolved via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, NOT a path-string
  prefix. A prefix mis-fires on `🍄 the user's consulting brand/`, a symlink that lives
  inside the vault namespace but points at ~/dev/mycelium-vault -- a
  separate repo that HAS a GitHub remote and is a normal size. Targeting
  follows `git -C <dir>` and an explicit `git --git-dir <dir>`; the
  value-taking options (`-C`, `-c`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree`,
  `--namespace`) are matched WITH their separate-argument value, so a
  subcommand cannot hide behind the value or a quoted value's space.

- namespace-scoped (grep / find): fire whenever the command touches the
  vault path namespace (cwd under it, or the literal path in the
  command). The grep/find slow-walk concern is about the filesystem tree,
  not git, so these keep the path-prefix gate.

- target-scoped (rm -rf): parse the rm's OPERANDS, resolve each one
  against the effective cwd, and fire only when a resolved target IS a
  vault root or a direct child of one. See _rm_verdicts.

Escape hatch: prefix the command with VAULT_VALIDATOR_BYPASS=1.

# Two independent defects, and the rule advertised in the docstring above was
# never actually enforced:
#
#   1. `$HOME/vault` is a SHELL string sitting in a PYTHON regex. `$` is an
#      end-of-line anchor, so that branch parses as "end of line, then the
#      literal text HOME/vault" and cannot match any input, ever. The vault
#      ROOT — the most destructive target of all — was never blocked.
#   2. The four emoji branches are literal names anchored right after the
#      flags, so they only fire on a bare relative `rm -rf "⚙️ Meta"`. An
#      absolute `rm -rf "/Users/x/Brain/⚙️ Meta"` — the same deletion, spelled
#      the way an agent actually spells it — sailed straight through.
#
# Both are fixed by asking the filesystem instead of the string: parse the
# rm's operands, resolve each against the effective cwd, and compare the
# RESULT to the vault that governs it. Names stop mattering, so a vault whose
# folders are not the four hardcoded ones is covered too, and depth stops
# mattering, so every spelling of the same target behaves identically.
