"""
PreToolUse hook: block Write/Edit of handoff files that lack a non-empty
`consumes_when:` frontmatter field.

Why: handoff files are cross-session context bridges. Without an explicit
completion signal recorded at create time, the next session has no way to
know whether the bridged work is done — they pile up indefinitely. Vault
audit on 2026-04-26 found three long-shipped handoffs still in
`⚙️ Meta/`, each silently outdated.

A file is a handoff if EITHER:
  - filename matches *Handoff*.md / *handoff*.md / *-handoff-*.md /
    next-session-*.md, OR
  - frontmatter `type:` is handoff / session-handoff / session-starter /
    prompt

This hook fires on Write, Edit and MultiEdit. It scopes to a VAULT so it never
fires on unrelated projects elsewhere on disk.

Vault detection (issue #375): the old code read
`os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT", str(Path.home() / "vault"))`. Nothing sets
VAULT_ROOT, so it silently defaulted to ~/vault and in_vault() returned False
for every real file on any vault not literally named "vault" - the guard was
inert everywhere, with no signal that it was doing nothing.

Now: explicit $VAULT_ROOT wins; otherwise walk up from the target file for the
nearest ancestor containing a Meta-suffixed folder ("Meta" / "⚙️ Meta"), the
same signature scripts/_meta_resolver.py keys on. A AGENTS.md marker is NOT
usable here: every code repo has one, so it would fire this guard on source
trees. Detection is deliberately self-contained (no import off scripts/) so a
hook that gates every Write cannot be broken by an import error.

FAIL OPEN: if no vault can be identified, the write is allowed.

Bypass: HANDOFF_FRONTMATTER_BYPASS=1 in the environment.
