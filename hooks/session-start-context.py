Emit the SESSION START context as a JSON hookSpecificOutput payload.

Replaces a previous inline echo '{"hookSpecificOutput":...}' hook command
that triggered a known footgun on zsh: literal parentheses inside the
single-quoted JSON body were re-interpreted as subshell syntax in some
shell-runner contexts, blocking every UserPromptSubmit. Moving the JSON
into a Python script with json.dumps removes the shell-quoting surface
entirely.

Wired on SessionStart (NOT UserPromptSubmit): this is session-start guidance,
needed once. `once: true` is IGNORED in settings.json — the installer merges
this hooks.json into ~/.codex/settings.json, where a UPS `once` hook silently
re-fires EVERY message. Measured: this block + the instinct block re-injected
17x / 14x in one real session (MYC-2359). SessionStart fires once per
session-segment (startup / resume / post-compact), so the block lands in the
cached prefix and is served as cache-reads thereafter, not re-billed as fresh
tokens every turn.

    The loader is the honest place for this. Past a byte cliff the reader
    silently stops and entries below the cut are never seen; write-time tooling
    warns when the index grows, but a session that only READS it gets a
    truncated list and no signal. An index is proven by what LOADS, so the thing
    doing the loading announces what it could not load.

    Folded in here rather than shipped as its own SessionStart hook: that event
    is at its cold-start fan-out budget, and a housekeeping check does not earn
    a new subprocess on every session for the life of the install.

    Fail-open and cheap: any error yields no warning rather than a broken start.
