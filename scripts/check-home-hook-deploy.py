"""check-home-hook-deploy.py — every hook wired from ~/.codex/hooks/ must have
a route that actually puts it there.

THE BUG THIS CLOSES
    hooks.json invokes some hooks by their deployed home path:

        [ -f ~/.codex/hooks/pre-write-settings-lint.py ] && [PYTHON] ~/.codex/hooks/pre-write-settings-lint.py || true

    That `[ -f ]` guard is correct at RUNTIME — a user who deletes an optional
    hook should get silence, not an error on every prompt. But it also means a
    hook nobody ever COPIED to ~/.codex/hooks/ is indistinguishable from a hook
    the user turned off. It never fires, and nothing anywhere says so.

    pre-write-settings-lint.py, lint-claude-settings.py and
    check-claude-code-version.sh shipped that way: referenced by hooks.json,
    present in the repo's hooks/, copied by nothing — not the installer, not any
    phase doc. On a real install that is 11 wired references and 0 files on
    disk. The installer's own verification reported the install clean, because
    verify_paths_on_disk() only inspects ABS-owned commands and these were not
    owned. Shipped, wired, verified — and never once executed.

THE INVARIANT
    Every ~/.codex/hooks/<name> reference in hooks.json is covered by EXACTLY
    ONE of two deploy routes:

      1. INSTALLER — <name> is in install-hooks-user-level.py's
         HOME_HOOKS_INSTALLER_DEPLOYS, which copies it on every install.
         For substrate hooks that should be on every machine unconditionally.

      2. PHASE DOC — some phases/*.md carries a literal
         `cp .../hooks/<name> ~/.codex/hooks/` step, executed during
         /setup-brain. For hooks that are genuinely conditional — installed
         only after a user decision this installer cannot make for them.

    Neither route = the hook cannot fire. Both routes = the phase doc's
    copy-if-the-user-opts-in is silently pre-empted by the installer, so the
    documented choice is a lie. Both are failures.

    Route 2 is a WEAK route and route 1 is preferred for anything installed by
    default. A `cp` in a markdown file is POSIX-only (it cannot run on native
    Windows at all) and model-executed (it happens if an agent reads the doc
    and chooses to). retry-budget.py, validate-mcp-json.py and vault-context.py
    took route 2 until 2026-08-13, when a Windows install turned up with all
    three absent; they are installer-deployed now.

    THE SECOND INVARIANT (2026-08-13)
    Every `_lib.<mod>` imported by an installer-deployed hook is in
    HOME_HOOKS_LIB_DEPS, so the dependency ships with its consumer. These hooks
    catch the ImportError and fall back to a no-op, which means a missing _lib
    produces a hook that runs, exits 0, and silently does nothing — the same
    invisible failure, one layer down. See _lib_dependency_violations().

    The reverse direction is checked too: an entry in
    HOME_HOOKS_INSTALLER_DEPLOYS that hooks.json no longer references, or that
    the repo no longer ships, is dead weight that will rot.

WHY A LINT AND NOT A TEST
    The failure is invisible by construction — the guard makes the missing file
    look like a healthy install, so no runtime assertion can catch it. It has to
    be caught where the reference is introduced. Same family as
    scripts/check-utf8-stdout.py (#313) and scripts/check-vault-root-reads.py
    (#375/#404): the SILENT-NO-OP class, caught statically.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/check-home-hook-deploy.py     # exit 1 on any violation

Stdlib only. No network, no git, no writes.
