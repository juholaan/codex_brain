"""Find foreign git checkouts nested inside a vault — by PROPERTY, not by name.

WHY THIS IS NOT A NAME LIST
---------------------------
`vault-backup.sh` excludes machine-exhaust by name, and that list included
`./.claude/worktrees` — the per-session worktree directory the Codex Desktop
app creates. That is a denylist against an open set, and it loses to the next
tool that picks a different name.

Measured on a real install: a second agent CLI created its worktrees in a
directory the list did not name, parked eleven checkouts of three unrelated
repositories inside the vault, and added 37 GB to the backup source. Nothing
noticed for weeks; the first symptom was the offsite backup provider refusing
uploads because the storage cap was exceeded, which left the offsite copy
silently stale for 50+ days.

So this keys on the CHARACTERISTIC — a directory under the vault that carries
its own `.git` — which catches any tool regardless of what it names its
directory. Keep the named excludes too; they are cheap and they cover the
non-repo exhaust this cannot see.

WHY IT DOES NOT JUST EXCLUDE EVERY NESTED REPO
----------------------------------------------
A vault can legitimately contain a project directory that is a git repo with **no
remote** — a writing project, a rendered media folder, a scratch experiment. Its
bulk is usually working-tree content, not `.git`. Excluding "any nested repo"
would silently drop irreplaceable files from the only backup that exists, which
is a worse bug than the one being fixed.

So the classification is RECOVERABILITY, not repo-ness:

  RECOVERABLE   the checkout (or, for a linked worktree, its owning repo) has a
                git remote -> its content exists on a server -> EXCLUDE it.
  UNRECOVERABLE no remote anywhere -> the vault may be its only copy -> NEVER
                exclude. Report it loudly instead, so it gets a remote or moves
                out of the vault, but keep backing it up until a human decides.

Fail-open by construction: anything unclassifiable stays IN the backup. For a
backup, backing up too much costs storage; backing up too little loses data.

Usage:
  vault-nested-repos.py --vault-root DIR [--relative] [--exclude-file OUT] [--json]

  --relative      emit vault-relative `./path` entries (for `tar --exclude=`)
                  instead of absolute paths (for tools that take absolute).
Exit: 0 when it produced a usable answer (fail-open); 2 on bad usage.
