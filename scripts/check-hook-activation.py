"""Fail when a shipped hook is wired nowhere, or is wired but not installer-owned.

THE CLASS (MYC-1031, generalizing MYC-1017). A hook file in `hooks/` is a FILE.
Whether it ever RUNS on a user's machine is a separate fact, and nothing
structurally connected the two. "We ship guard X" kept being true at the file
level and false at the behavior level:

  * MYC-1017  the fabrication-guard family, dormant.
  * MYC-1031  sessionstart-hook-snapshot-guard.py, dormant.
  * MYC-782   check-cd-outside-worktree.py, dormant ~6 weeks while AGENTS.md
              described it as an active guard. Fixed in #371.

THE SPEC ERROR THIS CHECK EXISTS TO AVOID. MYC-1031 originally specified the
gate as "in the installer's owned set OR in hooks.json". That `or` is wrong, and
a gate built to it would have PASSED the third instance. `merge_hooks()` wires
exactly what hooks.json declares; ABS_FINGERPRINTS / ABS_OWNED_BASENAMES carry
only OWNERSHIP semantics (dedup / replace / retire / uninstall). A hook in the
owned set but absent from hooks.json is an OWNED DORMANT HOOK.

  hooks.json membership is the activation predicate. Owned-set membership is not.

TWO ASSERTIONS, separate so each failure names its own cause:

  A. ACTIVATION. Every top-level hooks/*.py is wired in an activation channel,
     or carries an explicit written reason. Silence is the only banned state.
  B. OWNERSHIP. Every hook we wire is also OWNED by the installer. Not
     activation -- but an unowned wired hook cannot be deduped, replaced or
     retired, so a re-install duplicates a hand-wired copy instead of replacing
     it, and verify_paths_on_disk() skips it (the hole #406 closed by hand).

TWO ACTIVATION CHANNELS, both real -- checking only one false-positives:
  * hooks.json        the installer template (install-hooks-user-level.py)
  * hooks/hooks.json  the plugin manifest (how install-ping.py activates)

WHAT THIS CHECK DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not judge whether a wired
hook can still deliver a verdict. That is
scripts/check-hook-block-protocol.py's job (#405: a blocking hook under the
allow-fallback wrapper is rewritten into an ALLOW), and
scripts/check-hook-emission-channel.py's (MYC-3246: a warning written to a
stderr the wiring discards). Three checks, three disjoint questions -- is it
wired, is it owned, can it speak. Overlapping them would double-report one file
and let the duplicated rule drift into conflicting advice.

BASELINE RATCHET. Both assertions carry pre-existing debt, so they run as
ratchets: listed names are tolerated, the count may never GROW, and a name that
becomes wired/owned or disappears must be REMOVED (a stale entry fails). Debt
can only shrink.

ASCII-only output on purpose -- see scripts/check-utf8-stdout.py.

    KNOWN LIMITATION, accepted deliberately. This matches ANY `hooks/<name>`
