install-hooks-user-level.py — install ai-brain-starter hooks at USER level.

Closes mycelium-hq/ai-brain-starter#6 — UserPromptSubmit hooks silently fail
in worktrees when installed at project level. User-level hooks
(~/.codex/settings.json) fire universally regardless of worktree.

What it does:
  1. Reads the canonical hooks.json from the skill repo
  2. Reads existing ~/.codex/settings.json (preserves all user content)
  3. Merges ai-brain-starter hooks into the user-level config
  4. De-duplicates by command-string fingerprint (idempotent re-runs)
  5. Backs up the existing settings.json before edit
  6. Verifies post-write JSON validity, rolls back on parse error

Safety:
  - Backup at ~/.codex/settings.json.bak-{timestamp} before any edit
  - JSON validity verified after write; rollback on parse error
  - Custom user hooks NEVER removed (we only add ai-brain-starter entries)
  - Idempotent: a second run detects already-installed hooks via fingerprint
  - --dry-run shows the planned merge without writing
  - --uninstall removes ONLY the ai-brain-starter entries (matched by
    fingerprint substring); leaves everything else intact

Usage:
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py                          # install
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --dry-run                # preview
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --uninstall              # remove
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --hooks-source PATH      # custom source
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --quiet                  # only summary
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --verify                 # install, then verify
  python3 install-hooks-user-level.py --verify-only            # verify only, writes nothing

Why user-level: project-level hooks at <project>/.claude/settings.json
silently don't fire when cwd is inside <project>/.codex/worktrees/<name>/.
The Codex hook resolver appears to treat .claude/ as a boundary it
won't cross when looking up project hooks. User-level config is universal —
fires on every session regardless of cwd.

We ship hooks.json as the canonical source. This script is the install
mechanism; the source-of-truth content lives in hooks.json.

# `text=True` alone decodes with locale.getpreferredencoding(False) — cp1252 on
# a Spanish/Portuguese/French Windows, cp437 under cmd.exe, ASCII in a C-locale
# pipe. Every child this installer runs prints the VAULT PATH, and that path
# contains "⚙️ Meta" — U+FE0F decodes to byte 0x8F under cp1252, which has no

# Code memory into the vault" on a machine where the linker itself was fine,

# This is the READ side of the cp1252 bug that #313 fixed on the WRITE side
# (the sys.stdout.reconfigure guard at the bottom of this file, enforced fleet-

# !! THIS LIST DOES NOT INSTALL ANYTHING. !!
#
# Membership here confers OWNERSHIP only: dedup, replace, retire, uninstall
# recognition. `merge_hooks()` wires exactly what `hooks.json` declares and
# nothing else, so **hooks.json is the ONLY activation predicate**. A hook
# added here but not to hooks.json is an "owned dormant hook": the installer
# claims it, inspection makes it look registered, and it never fires.
#
# Adding a hook therefore takes BOTH:
#   1. an entry in hooks.json  <- this is what actually installs it
#   2. an entry here (+ ABS_OWNED_BASENAMES) so re-installs dedup it properly
#
# If it signals by EXIT CODE 2 (a blocking gate), wire it in hooks.json as
# `if [ -f <path> ]; then <path>; else <allow-json>; fi` — the common
# `<path> 2>/dev/null || echo <allow-json>` idiom discards the stderr message
# AND rewrites the block into an allow.
#
# This comment replaced "Extend this list when adding new hooks", which read as
# the complete instruction and is how the most recent dormant hook happened:
# the author registered in both lists below, believed it was active, and said
# so in the commit message. Tracked as MYC-1031 (structural CI gate).

# retry-budget.py, validate-mcp-json.py and vault-context.py joined this set
# 2026-08-13, from a field report on a Windows install where all three were
# absent from ~/.codex/hooks/. They used to take the PHASE-DOC route: three
# literal `cp` lines in phases/phase-05-context-layer.md, executed by the MODEL
# during /setup-brain. Three things were wrong with that:
#
#   1. POSIX-ONLY. `cp` and `mkdir -p` are not commands on native Windows, so
#      the step could not run there at all — and its failure is invisible,
#      because the `[ -f ]` guard turns every missing hook into silence.
#   2. MODEL-EXECUTED. A copy step that depends on an agent reading a markdown
#      table and choosing to run it is not a deploy route; it is a suggestion.
#      Nothing verified it afterwards on any platform.
#   3. THE DEPENDENCY WAS NEVER SHIPPED. vault-context.py does
#      `from _lib.vault_root import vault_root_for` and falls back to a stub
#      returning None when that import fails. Nothing ever copied hooks/_lib/
#      to ~/.codex/hooks/, so even a SUCCESSFUL `cp` of the .py landed a hook
#      that resolved no vault and injected nothing, on every platform, forever
#      — fail-open, exit 0, no output. See HOME_HOOKS_LIB_DEPS.
#
# The phase doc no longer copies them (its `cp` lines are gone). Do not add one
# back: scripts/check-home-hook-deploy.py fails on BOTH routes as loudly as on
# neither, because a phase doc offering a choice the installer already made is

    Windows runs hook commands under PowerShell 5.1 (no `||`), PowerShell 7,

    all four, so before this rewrite every hook errored visibly on every

        py -3 "<abs>/scripts/hook_runner.py" --fallback silent "<abs>/<hook>.py"

    hook_runner.py reproduces the masking semantics of the shell forms (see

    propagates; any other failure -> fallback JSON.

    Rules per command:

    Contract:
      - templates/hookify-rules/activation.json's 'default' list names the rules
        that auto-activate; everything else is opt-in (manual cp).
      - COPY-IF-ABSENT: an existing destination is never overwritten, so a user's
        customized rule (the README tells them to customize) survives re-install
        and the daily update run.
      - Fail-loud under fail_on_missing ONLY when the manifest PROMISES a
        default template that is not on disk (governed-set drift: the manifest
        claims a rule ships, but it does not). A missing or unreadable manifest
        is treated as "feature unavailable" and skipped, never fatal, so a
        partial or older checkout still installs its hooks. Outside
        fail_on_missing a missing default template only warns; rule activation
        never blocks the core hooks install unless asked to fail closed on a
        broken promise.

    Returns 0 normally, 1 only under fail_on_missing when the manifest names a
    default template that is missing on disk.
