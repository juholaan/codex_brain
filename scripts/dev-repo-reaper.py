"""dev-repo-reaper — the durable close-loop for ~/dev branch/worktree/stash drift (MYC-683).

The automations that CREATE drift (per-session `claude/<slug>` branches,
dev-repo-worktrees, dev-repo-checkpoints) shipped no reaper, so the pile grew
unbounded (50->125 unpushed commits in 5 days, unnoticed). This walks every
~/dev git repo and reaps ONLY what is provably safe — content already on origin:

  REAP   : TRUE_MERGED + SQUASH_MERGED_STALE branches (not checked out),
           CLEAN worktrees on those branches (`git worktree remove`, NEVER --force),
           surplus/old `claude-checkpoint` stashes (keep newest-K + TTL).
  SURFACE: RELIC + GENUINE_UNIQUE branches — real un-backed-up state, printed for
           a human, NEVER auto-deleted.
  SKIP    : dirty worktrees, named (parked) stashes, the default branch, any branch
           checked out anywhere, and any repo with a live .session-lock.

PRE-SCAN FETCH (freshness belt): before planning, `git fetch --quiet origin` on
each primary repo so (a) merged-branch classification sees CURRENT origin refs
(else a branch merged on a fresher origin mis-surfaces as unpushed) and (b) the
~/dev fleet's origin/main never rots far behind — the read-time
STALE-BARE-CHECKOUT-READ guard then starts from a fresh ref instead of a 300-
commit-stale one. Read-only, fail-open per repo, bounded. `--no-fetch` skips it.

MERGED-PR CHECK (authoritative, MYC-2347): also before planning, `gh pr list
--state merged` per repo yields the set of head-branches whose PRs merged. A
branch (or its worktree) in that set is reapable even after origin/main has
advanced past its merge — the squash-merge diff FALSE-NEGATIVE that otherwise
left 47 merged worktrees (~170G) unreaped in one repo. Fail-open per repo
(gh missing / unauthed / offline → diff heuristic → preserve). `--no-fetch` skips
it too (an offline run has no auth for gh either).

DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT. `--apply` performs the reaps and writes a recovery manifest
(branch->sha, worktree->branch->sha, stash->message) to ~/.codex/logs/dev-repo-reaper/
so every deletion is reversible from reflog + the manifest.

The reap/preserve decision lives in _lib/dev_repo_scan.py and is proven RED-then-green
by hooks/test_dev_repo_reaper.py (neg-control: merged reaped, unmerged+dirty+named preserved).

Usage:
  dev-repo-reaper.py                 # dry-run, the whole dev-root fleet
  dev-repo-reaper.py --apply         # execute the safe tier + write manifest
  dev-repo-reaper.py --repo ~/dev/x  # one repo
  dev-repo-reaper.py --json          # machine-readable plan
  dev-repo-reaper.py --keep-k 10 --ttl-days 14
  dev-repo-reaper.py --no-fetch      # skip the pre-scan origin fetch (CI/offline)
