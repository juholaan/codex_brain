# The chokepoint-guard pattern: classify, fail-closed page, dedup-on-delivery, backstop

When a system captures something durable (a user emits content that lands on
disk or in a store and is read back later), a policy violation in that content
is worth catching **at the moment of capture**, not only on a downstream sweep.
Catching it later leaves a window where the violation is live and nobody knows.

This document describes a reusable pattern for guarding a single capture
chokepoint with a synchronous detector that can never break the thing it
guards. It is **pattern-not-mechanic**: the shape ports to any runtime; the
specific channels and criteria are yours to fill in.

## The bug classes it prevents

- **`SILENT-NO-OP-ON-UNEVALUABLE-SPEC`.** A detector that is handed a rule it
  cannot evaluate and quietly does nothing. No error, looks healthy, catches
  nothing.
- **`GUARD-RECORDS-DEDUP-ON-ATTEMPT-NOT-DELIVERY`.** A detector that marks an
  incident "already handled" the moment it *tries* to alert, so when every
  alert channel silently fails, a backstop that shares the dedup state skips it
  and the incident goes unhandled forever.
- **`GUARD-FAILS-THE-THING-IT-GUARDS`.** An alert path that raises and takes the
  capture down with it. The guard becomes a new way to lose user writes.

## The shape

```
capture chokepoint (one place, after the durable write succeeds)
  -> classify(event_props, criteria_registry) -> verdict     # pure, synchronous
  -> maybe_page(verdict, page_fn, dedup_store) -> result      # fail-closed
       -> dedup-on-delivery: record ONLY if >=1 channel delivered
  -> a backstop poller shares the SAME dedup store and re-finds
     anything that blackholed
```

Five properties make it safe.

### 1. One chokepoint, not many

Find the single function every durable write of a given kind passes through and
guard *that*. One proven chokepoint beats five aspirational ones. Wire the hook
to fire **after** the write and its audit/log succeed, so a guard failure can
never prevent a write that already landed.

### 2. A pure classifier

```python
def classify(event_props, criteria_registry) -> Verdict:
    """Map props -> verdict. No I/O, no clock, no globals. Deterministic."""
```

Purity means you can unit-test every criterion in isolation, and the same input
always yields the same verdict. The classifier decides *what matched*; it does
not page, log, or touch a network.

### 3. Criteria are DATA, and absence is dormant, never a silent no-op

Express each criterion as data (a small record), composed into a registry that
can be scoped per-tenant or per-event-type. Two failure modes to design against
explicitly:

- **Dormant-tolerance.** A criterion keyed on a field the schema does not emit
  *yet* must be **skipped** (the absent field is not a violation), not
  mis-fired. Make this explicit in the criterion (e.g. a `dormant_if_absent`
  list), so a future schema can light the criterion up by simply starting to
  emit the field.
- **Fail-loud on the unevaluable.** If the registry is a shape the classifier
  cannot evaluate, **report it** in the verdict's reason. Never accept a spec
  you cannot run and then quietly do nothing. That is the worst failure,
  because it looks healthy.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Criterion:
    name: str
    severity: int
    requires_true: tuple[str, ...] = ()        # these props must be exactly True
    requires_not_true: tuple[str, ...] = ()    # present-and-not-True
    dormant_if_absent: tuple[str, ...] = ()    # absent => skip this criterion
```

### 4. Fail-closed paging

```python
def maybe_page(verdict, *, page_fn, targets, dedup_store, ...) -> Result:
    """NEVER raises into the caller. A page failure is logged to a
    scoped failure sink; the capture still succeeds."""
```

`maybe_page` is wrapped in an absolute try/except, and each channel attempt is
wrapped too, so one bad channel cannot stop the others and no failure escapes to
the caller. A failed alert is logged to a **scoped failure sink** (your audit
log, keyed to the tenant/user). Never dropped, never surfaced as a 500 on the
write.

The page channel is injected (`page_fn`), so tests never touch a network and a
new channel is a drop-in. A good universal default is an **incoming-webhook
POST** (a `{"text": ...}` JSON body) to a per-tenant URL configured in your
tenant config: every incident stack (Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, a custom
endpoint) accepts one. Validate any user-supplied webhook URL against SSRF (scheme
allowlist, no embedded credentials, public-IP assertion) both when it is set and
again at send time (a DNS-rebind defense).

### 5. Dedup-on-delivery + a backstop poller

This is the subtle one. Record a deduplication key **only if at least one
channel actually delivered**:

```python
delivered = any(channel_results.values())
if delivered and dedup_key:
    dedup_store.mark(dedup_key)
# else: leave the store UNTOUCHED, so a backstop re-finds this incident
```

If you record on *attempt*, an incident whose every channel blackholed gets
marked "done", and a backstop poller that shares the dedup store skips it
forever. Recording on *delivery* means a fully-failed page is left un-deduped,
so the backstop re-finds and re-pages it. The backstop poller reads the durable
sink, runs the same classifier, and shares the same dedup store, so a delivered
incident is suppressed and a blackholed one is recovered.

(A reasonable refinement: let the highest-severity verdicts bypass dedup
entirely, since a separate durable emit of the same high-severity asset is a
separate violation worth re-alerting.)

## Why synchronous-at-capture beats poller-only

A downstream poller alone leaves a live-violation window and gives no
synchronous signal at the moment of emit. The poller is a **complement**, the
backstop that recovers blackholed pages, not a replacement for catching the
violation as it happens.

## Checklist to port it

1. Pick the one capture chokepoint. Fire the hook after the write + audit
   succeed.
2. Write a pure `classify` that reads event props against a data-driven
   criteria registry. Make absence dormant; make an unevaluable registry
   fail-loud.
3. Add an optional per-tenant alert target (a webhook URL is a good default).
   Absent => log-only. SSRF-validate it at set time and send time.
4. Make `maybe_page` fail-closed: never raise into the caller; log failures to a
   scoped sink.
5. Dedup-on-delivery: record only when a channel delivered.
6. Add a backstop poller that shares the dedup store and re-runs the classifier
   over the durable sink.
7. Test every case: exempt/clean (no page), each criterion (pages), absent-field
   (dormant), channel-raises (fail-closed), dedup (pages once),
   all-channels-failed (does NOT dedup), partial-failure (still dedups).

## Probe the guard, not just the fix

Once a guard ships, it is the thing most likely to be wrong, because nothing is
guarding *it*. A guard that reports green is indistinguishable from a guard that
works — the same false-green class it was written to catch. Re-reading it does not
find the holes. Feeding it deliberate offenders does.

Worked example, MYC-3536 (2026-07-31). The guards shipped in #429 looked right and
passed review. Probing them found three holes in minutes:

1. **Scope taken on faith.** The runtime tripwire watched `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
   The sweep from the *same* investigation had already shown only 3 of 10 escaping
   suites touched `settings.json` — the other 7 wrote elsewhere under `~/.codex`,
   six of them copying hook scripts into the live install. The guard would have
   missed 70% of the leaks that motivated it, and the evidence was in hand the
   whole time. **A guard's scan scope is its blind spot**: check it against the
   measured failure set, not against the one example that prompted it.
2. **Per-file where it needed per-site.** A file that sandboxed three call sites
   and leaked a fourth passed, because the paired variable appeared *somewhere* in
   the file. A proximity/window rule has the identical hole — the leaking line
   usually sits directly under a correctly paired one. Pair by **value**, not by
   nearness.
3. **Scope boundary never tested.** The scan covered `tests/integration/*.sh` only,
   so Python suites were invisible. One redirected `HOME` so a health test would use
   a temp DB; on Windows it read and wrote the developer's real `health.duckdb`,
   while its own comment asserted it was isolated.

Before calling guarded work done:

- Write a synthetic offender that *should* trip it. If it doesn't, the guard is decor.
- Write a synthetic clean case. If that trips, the guard gets disabled within a week,
  and a disabled guard is worse than none.
- Confirm the guard does not indict itself — its docs and fixtures contain the very
  pattern it hunts.
- Prefer a stable, targeted watch list over a whole-tree hash. Watching directories
  the runtime churns (logs, sessions, caches) makes the gate flaky, and flaky gates
  get turned off.
- State what the guard does NOT cover, in the guard. An exemption with a reason is a
  known gap; an unstated one is a surprise.
