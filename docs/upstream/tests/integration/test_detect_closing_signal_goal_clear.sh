# Test: detect-closing-signal.py emits PHASE 4b (/goal clear) when — and only
# when — this session has a /goal still set.
#
# Why: `/goal <condition>` installs a session-scoped Stop hook that blocks
# stopping until the condition holds. At a deliberate close that hook fights the
# cascade: the model finishes, Stop fires, the goal blocks it, and the model is
# re-invoked with nothing left to do. Only the user can run `/goal clear` (it is
# a client-side command with no tool behind it), so the cascade has to hand the
# instruction back to them.
#
# The goal condition lives only in Codex's in-memory session state — there
# is no goal state file — so detection replays the transcript's /goal command
# records. That makes precision the whole ballgame, hence the negative controls:
# a false PHASE 4b tells the user to clear a goal that is not there, and the
# harness explicitly rules out nagging about /goal clear after success.
#
# Assertions:
#   FIRES (PHASE 4b present):
#     1. /goal set, never cleared, substantive session
#     2. /goal set, trivial session (<5 user msgs) — a live goal blocks the
#        close regardless of session size, so it survives the skip-if-trivial rule
#     3. /goal set, cleared, then set again — last write wins
#   DOES NOT FIRE (no PHASE 4b):
#     4. no /goal anywhere in the transcript
#     5. /goal set then explicitly cleared with `/goal clear`
#     6. bare /goal with no args (that is a status query, not a set)
#     7. prose that merely mentions "/goal clear" with no command record
#        (precision control — this very repo's own commit messages do that)
#
