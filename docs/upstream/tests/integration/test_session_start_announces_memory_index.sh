# Fresh-install activation proof for the memory-index announcement.
#
# The bug this closes is ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-ACTIVATION: logic can sit in the repo
# fully tested and green while nothing installed ever runs it, so every install
# gets the code and none gets the behavior. File presence is NOT the assertion.
# The assertion is that the command the INSTALLER wires into settings.json, run
# verbatim, actually announces an unreachable memory.
#
# Asserts, against a sandboxed HOME:
#   0. NEGATIVE CONTROL: pre-install settings.json has no session-start loader.
#   1. The loader is registered on SessionStart by the real installer.
#   2. The registered command names a script that exists.
#   3. END-TO-END: that command, run verbatim against a memory dir with an
#      unreachable memo, announces it.                      <- activation works
#   4. END-TO-END negative control: healthy dir -> no announcement.
#   5. The announcement rides the SAME payload as the session context, so it
#      costs no extra SessionStart cold start (that event is at fan-out budget).
