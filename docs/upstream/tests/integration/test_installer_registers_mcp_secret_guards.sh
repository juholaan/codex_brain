# Fresh-install smoke for the never-wired MCP secret guards (the
# block-codex-mcp-inline-secret.py / block-mcp-config-inline-secret.py pair).
#
# THE BUG CLASS THIS CLOSES: ARTIFACT-WITHOUT-ACTIVATION. Both guards were
# written after three real GitHub PAT leaks and shipped as working files --
# referenced nowhere (not hooks.json, not a phase doc, not a settings
# template) -- so they never once fired on any install. File presence is
# therefore NOT the assertion; registration in the installed settings.json
# is, plus proof the registered command actually BLOCKS a seeded secret.
#
# Asserts, by running the REAL installer against a sandboxed HOME, for EACH
# guard:
#   0. NEGATIVE CONTROL: a pre-install settings.json does not have the guard.
#   1. The guard is registered on PreToolUse after install.
#   2. The registered script EXISTS at the path the command names.
#   3. The command uses the `if [ -f ]` form, NOT `2>/dev/null || echo <allow>`.
#      A blocking hook wired the second way has its stderr discarded and its
#      exit-2 converted into an allow -- registered, running, and inert.
#   4. END-TO-END: the registered command, run verbatim against a payload
#      carrying an obviously-fake secret, BLOCKS (rc=2). <- activation works
#   5. END-TO-END negative control: the same command against a clean payload
#      does NOT block (rc=0).                            <- no false block
#   6. Idempotent: a second install does not duplicate either entry.
#
# Stdlib python3 + bash. No network. Tmpdir removed on exit.
