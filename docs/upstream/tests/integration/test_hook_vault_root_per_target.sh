# Test: every hook remediated by MYC-3529 resolves its vault PER TARGET, and
# therefore fires on a vault that is NOT the one $VAULT_ROOT names.
#
# THE ASSERTION THIS CLASS WAS MISSING
#   MYC-2505 (#407) surveyed the fleet and found 52 naive `VAULT_ROOT` reads.
#   Twelve of them were tagged SEV-A: all in hooks/, all shaped
#       VAULT = os.environ.get("VAULT_ROOT", str(Path.home() / "vault"))
#   which fails silently in both directions. UNSET it resolves to ~/vault, so
#   the hook is inert on every vault not literally named "vault". SET it names
#   exactly ONE vault, so a target in any OTHER vault resolves against the wrong
#   root, the containment check returns False, and the hook SKIPS the thing it
#   exists to check -- failing OPEN, with no output at all.
#
#   #404 fixed this once, in hooks/validate-handoff-frontmatter.py. The bug had
#   survived that long precisely because the suite was not hermetic: every test
#   ran against the vault $VAULT_ROOT already named, so "resolve from the env
#   var" and "resolve from the target" were indistinguishable. A test written
#   that way re-creates the blind spot no matter how many cases it has.
#
#   So EVERY assertion below points $VAULT_ROOT at a DECOY vault and then acts
#   on a DIFFERENT one. A hook that still reads the env var naively cannot pass:
#   it will either do nothing (silent open) or answer for the decoy.
#
# STRUCTURE
#   $TMP/decoy-vault    a real, populated vault. $VAULT_ROOT points here in
#                       every assertion, and no assertion wants its content.
#   $TMP/other-vault    the vault each hook must actually resolve to.
#   $TMP/coderepo       NOT a vault (no Meta-suffixed folder) -- the negative
#                       control that keeps the fixes from over-firing.
#   $TMP/home           HOME/USERPROFILE override, so the ~/dev-scoped and
#                       ~/.codex-scoped hooks are hermetic too.
#
# Bash + python3 only, no network. exit 0 = every remediated hook is per-target.

#
# TWO DEFECTS LIVED IN THIS CASE, and both made it assert something other than
# what it claimed:
#
#  (a) SUBSTRING COLLISION. It grepped the bare string "auto-snapshot". The
#      hook's message ends in a FIXED footer -- "...auto-snapshot.sh failed
#      every hour for 48+ hours unnoticed" -- so that string is present in
#      output emitted for ANY reason at all, by any pass. The negative half
#      therefore declared a cross-vault leak whenever the hook printed
#      anything whatsoever, and the positive half could be satisfied by that
#      prose alone even if resolution had regressed to the decoy. Both halves
#      now decode the JSON and assert on the STRUCTURE of a finding: its label,
#      and the vault its `log:` line names. A finding is a fact; the footer is
#      narration, and only the fact may satisfy an assertion.
#
#  (b) NON-HERMETIC. launchd_failures() shells out to the host's real
#      `launchctl list` and reports every failing user-installed job. Those are
#      machine-global BY DESIGN (pinned in 8d) and belong to no vault, but the
#      fixture fakes HOME, USERPROFILE and VAULT_ROOT and cannot fake the
#      launchd domain. So this case ran green on Linux CI (no launchctl ->

#      that happened to have a failing job -- decided by ambient machine state
#      rather than by the code under test, which is not a test result at all.
#      `launchctl` is now stubbed on PATH: the last host surface the fixture
#      had left open.
#
# The hook itself needed no change. It already resolves through the sanctioned
# per-target resolver, and 8a/8b/8c below prove that positively, negatively,
