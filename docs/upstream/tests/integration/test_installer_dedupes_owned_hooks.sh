# test_installer_dedupes_owned_hooks.sh - the installer collapses a duplicate OWNED-hook
# copy and never touches a user's own hooks.
#
# The matcher-aware merge (which correctly registers a hook under every matcher it ships
# under) exposed a latent class: an owned hook whose stored command text drifts (bare
# `python3` -> absolute shim-safe interpreter) is not literally == the template command,
# so on a machine that already carried a second stale copy the replace touched only the
# first and a duplicate persisted. observe-tool-calls ships under two matchers and hit
# exactly this. Fix = own it (dedup by basename) + a dedupe pass that self-heals machines
# already carrying the duplicate.
#
# Controls (a guard earns trust only by FAILING/ACTING on the thing it catches):
#   1. observe-tool-calls.py is OWNED (else basename dedup can't recognize the drift copy).
#   2. NEGATIVE-ish: a group with two owned copies of the same script collapses to ONE,
#      keeping the freshest (last) copy.
#   3. POSITIVE: a user's own duplicate-looking hooks are left completely intact.
#   4. END-TO-END: a fresh install of the REAL hooks.json wires observe under BOTH of its
#      matchers, once each, and a re-run is idempotent (no dedup, no growth).
