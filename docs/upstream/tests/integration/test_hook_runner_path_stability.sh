#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The hook_runner.py path baked into settings.json must be STABLE (MYC-3536).
#
# THE BUG
#
# platformize_template_for_windows() wires every Windows hook as
#     py -3 "<abs>/scripts/hook_runner.py" --fallback silent "<abs>/hooks/<x>.py"
# and used to derive <abs> from Path(__file__).parent — i.e. whatever checkout
# happened to run the installer. Run it (or any test that invokes it) from a
# throwaway git worktree under $TMP and all ~95 hook entries point into that
# worktree. The path is then persisted in settings.json and outlives the process.
#
# When the worktree is deleted the launcher cannot open the runner. CPython exits
# 2 for "can't open file", and exit 2 is Codex's intentional-BLOCK signal —
# not "hook unavailable". So every tool call in every later session is DENIED,
# with nothing tying the failure back to the worktree that caused it. Observed
# live 2026-07-30: 95 of 111 entries pointed at four deleted temp worktrees.
# Same fail-closed class as #375 and #409.
#
# hook_runner.py already fails open when its TARGET is missing. It cannot defend
# against its own absence — it is not running. So the fix is upstream: never bake
# a disposable path in the first place.
#
# Asserts (unit-level, so it runs on Linux CI as well as Windows — the Windows
# rewrite itself is platform-gated, this resolution is not):
#   1. An installed ~/.agents/skills/.../scripts/hook_runner.py WINS over the
#      running checkout — the actual fix.
#   2. NEGATIVE CONTROL: with no installed copy, it falls back to the checkout,
#      so a first install from a dev tree still wires a runner that exists.
#   3. ABS_HOOK_RUNNER overrides both (hermetic-test escape hatch).
#   4. The resolved path never lands inside a scratchpad worktree when an
#      installed copy exists — the exact shape of the live incident.
#
# Stdlib python3 + bash only. Exit 0 = pass.
