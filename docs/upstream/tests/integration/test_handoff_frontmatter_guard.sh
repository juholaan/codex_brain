# Test: hooks/validate-handoff-frontmatter.py — the handoff `consumes_when:` guard.
#
# Covers issue #375 bug 3. The guard shipped for months but was never registered,
# and even when hand-wired it was inert: VAULT_ROOT defaulted to ~/vault, so
# in_vault() was False for every real vault not literally named "vault".
#
# The controls below FAIL against the pre-fix hook:
#   - vault-autodetected-*  : pre-fix resolved ~/vault, so it never fired
#   - deny-is-json-*        : pre-fix wrote stderr + exit 2, which hooks.json's
#                             `|| echo {allow}` wrapper rewrites into an ALLOW
#   - multiedit-*           : pre-fix ignored MultiEdit entirely
set -uo pipefail

# HERMETIC: the running account's real $VAULT_ROOT must not leak into the
# autodetection controls (it points at a DIFFERENT vault and silently answered
# for every case while this test was being written).
